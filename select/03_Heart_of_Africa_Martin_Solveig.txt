So the whole reason the French people can't really dance
Is because they haven't got the beat in their blood.
And why don't they live and breathe the beat?
Because their language has no tonic accent.

This is something about the energy you can find in music.
Well, I mean, specifically of the music.
As I understand it, it's dynamic and bouncing, moving
Because it's driven by the beat.

Yeah, and it's simple of course
The drumbeat that this is actually the hoping.
Well I think it's the heartbeat, really, many of many people of once.
You can feel it if you get into it, basically, it's the heart of Africa.

[Sax solo]

The heart of Africa, the heart of Africa.
The heart of Africa, the heart of Africa.
The heart of Africa, the heart of Africa.
The heart of Africa, heart of Africa, heart of Africa, heart of Africa.

[Sax solo]

Now I want you to make up your own mind.
It has to come from deep inside your soul.
Yeah, and you'll be able to join the thousand of dancers
United by the beat to celebrate the heart of Africa.

[Sax solo]

The heart of Africa, the heart of Africa.
The heart of Africa, the heart of Africa.
The heart of Africa, the heart of Africa.
The heart of Africa, heart of Africa, heart of Africa, heart of Africa.
