# TOTO – Africa

```
I hear the drums echoing tonight
And she has only whispers
of some quiet conversation
She's coming in,
twelve-thirty flight
The moonlit wings reflect
the stars that guide me
towards salvation
I stopped an old man
along the way
Hoping to find
some long forgotten words
or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say
“Hurry, boy,
it's waiting there for you"
Gonna take a lot
to drag me away from you
There's nothing
that a hundred men
or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time
to do the things we never have
For you
The wild dogs cry out
in the night
As they grown restless
longing for some solitary
company
I know that
I must do what's right
Sure as Kilimanjaro rises
like a limbless
above the sad Kenya
I seek to cure
what's deep inside
Frightened of this thing
that I've become
Gonna take a lot
to drag me away from you
There's nothing
that a hundred men
or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time
to do the things we never have
For you
Hurry boys,
she's waiting there for you
Gonna take a lot
to drag me away from you
There's nothing
that a hundred men
or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
I bless the rains down in Africa
I bless the rains down in Africa
I bless the rains down in Africa
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time
to do the things we never have
For you
